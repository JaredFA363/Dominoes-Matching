# Domino Matching Program

## Overview

This project implements a program in C++ to match dominoes from a given file. The primary objective is to measure and analyze the time complexity of different implementations of the domino matching algorithm.

## Features

- Read dominoes from an input file
- Implement multiple algorithms for matching dominoes
- Measure and compare the time complexity of each implementation

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Dominoes-Matching.git
    ```

2. **Build the project**:
    ```sh
    make
    ```

3. **Run the program**:
    ```sh
    ./domino_matcher data/input.txt
    ```

## Acknowledgements

This project was developed to explore and analyze different algorithms for matching dominoes in terms of their time complexity.
